EverOS is a web-integrated, cloud-based Operating System (OS) Simulator , made in JavaScript, designed and created to simulate Command Line Interface (CLI)/ Shell programs.

It is a simulation platform that mimics how a CLI program environment works and function, where users interact via via type-written commands or keyboard shortcuts. Whether you're learning how command-line systems operate or exploring useful utilities in a terminal-like interface, EverOS offers a simple, hands-on experience online without the needs to install anything.

EverOS is created and designed for everyone who wants to learn and understand the concepts of command-line interfaces, operating systems, and basic utility tools in an interactive and beginner-friendly way. The commands integrated in this system actually mimics the simplicity of Python’s syntax and Minecraft’s basic commands.

As a platform that simulates Operating System, it currently contains four usable function processes which I denoted as the Operating System’s “Features”. These features are the following:

->1. A simple mathematical calculator Performs basic mathematical calculations which can supports multiple operands (numerical values) and operators, parenthesis statements, and even negative and decimal values.

->2. Body Mass Index (BMI) calculator Calculates BMI using your height and weight values in supported measurements to assess your current health status.

->3. Temperature converter Easily converts temperature values between Celsius (°C) and Fahrenheit (°F), helping users switch between units with simple, command-based inputs.

->4. Day-time converter Converts units of time (day, hour, minute, seconds) between each other.

To view the list of important commands in the system, simply type “help” on the input box.

EverOS is a unique platform system designed to simulate a terminal, CLI-like OS programs, integrated online without the need to install or download any extension or application to work. The system utilizes type-written commands and shortcut keys for a better navigation workaround.
