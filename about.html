        <p>
            <b>EverAS</b> (AS stands for Application Suite/System) is a web-integrated, 
            cloud based application system, designed to simulate how a command-line interface (CLI) functions and works. 
        </p>     
        <p>
            <b>EverAS</b> is designed to run on both desktop and mobile devices, with portability, and simplicity as the priority. 
            This system is made for everyone curious about how a CLI operates — 
            from students and beginners learning computing basics to developers wanting a lightweight, 
            portable environment accessible on desktop and mobile. 
            Unlike traditional operating systems or desktop-only shells, 
            <b>EverAS</b> runs entirely in your browser, combining cloud accessibility, device portability, 
            and modular CLI-style tools in a single suite. 
        </p>   
        <p>
            <b>EverAS</b> uses simple commands such as <u>help</u> for displaying important commands, 
            <u>clear</u> for clearing the console screen, 
            and <u>exit</u> for exiting a current feature you opened and nav + feature for navigating to any features.
        </p>
        <p>
            Currently, <b>EverAS</b> contains different applications known as “features”. These features are the following:
        </p>
        <p>1. Home menu – the default screen for the system. Features a date and dynamic clock.</p>
        <p>2. Main menu – a sub-feature under home menu. 
            Displays the current system’s  feature and their respective names to be used with the nav command.</p>
        <p>3 . Mathematical calculator – A simple tool for performing basic mathematical operations. 
            Now supports logging and lets you access your operation history through integrated database fields.</p>
        <p>4. Body Mass Index (BMI) calculator – This feature allows you to estimate your body fat percentage by taking your height and weight value. 
            Height value supports cm, m, ft & in while Weight value supports kg and lbs. </p>
        <p>5. Day-Time converter –  Instantly convert any time unit (days, hours, minutes, seconds) to another equivalent unit.</p>
        <p>6. Temperature converter – Instantly convert temperature values like Celsius (°C) to Fahrenheit (°F) and vice versa.</p>
        <p>7. Ping Pong – A simple game of the classic title. You are in for a Player vs COM game. First to score 20 points win the game. </p>
        <p>8. ASCII animation test-  an experimental feature that showcases a short animation, made in multiple frames of ASCII characters.</p>
