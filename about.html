    <div id="about" id="id-container">
        <p>
            <b>EverOS</b> is a web-integrated, cloud-based Operating System (OS) Simulator ,
            made in JavaScript, designed and created 
            to simulate Command Line Interface (CLI)/ Shell programs. 
        </p>     
        <p>
            It is a simulation platform that mimics how a CLI program environment works and function, 
            where users interact via via type-written commands or keyboard shortcuts. 
            Whether you're learning how command-line systems operate or exploring useful utilities in a terminal-like interface, 
            <b>EverOS</b> offers a simple, hands-on experience online without the needs to install anything.
        </p>   
        <p>
            <b>EverOS</b> is created and designed for everyone who wants to learn and understand 
            the concepts of command-line interfaces, operating systems, and basic utility tools 
            in an interactive and beginner-friendly way. 
            The commands integrated in this system actually mimics 
            the simplicity of Python’s syntax and Minecraft’s basic commands.
        </p>
        <p>
            As a platform that simulates Operating System, 
            it currently contains four usable function processes 
            which I denoted as the Operating System’s “Features”. 
            These features are the following:
        </p>
        <p>->1. A simple mathematical calculator 
            Performs basic mathematical calculations 
            which can supports multiple operands (numerical values) 
            and operators, parenthesis statements, and even negative and decimal values.
        </p>
        <p>
            ->2. Body Mass Index (BMI) calculator 
            Calculates BMI using your height and weight values 
            in supported measurements to assess your current health status.
        </p>
        <p>
            ->3. Temperature converter 
            Easily converts temperature values between Celsius (°C) and Fahrenheit (°F), 
            helping users switch between units with simple, command-based inputs.
        </p>
        <p>
            ->4. Day-time converter 
            Converts units of time (day, hour, minute, seconds) between each other.
        </p>
        <p>To view the list of important commands in the system, simply type “help” on the input box.</p>
        <p>
            <b>EverOS</b> is a unique platform system designed to simulate a terminal, 
            CLI-like OS programs, integrated online 
            without the need to install or download any extension or application to work. 
            The system utilizes type-written commands and shortcut keys for a better navigation workaround.
